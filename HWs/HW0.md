# HW 0

This homework will help you with some setup and preparation for the course.

## Course Overview

**TODO:** Review the [course syllabus]

## Slack

The primary mode of communication for the course this semester will be Slack. Communication is essential in software engineering and the majority of development teams use some form of IM or messaging system. Slack is one example of these types of platforms, and we will use Slack to provide course updates, answer questions, form project groups, and other course activities. You may download the free version of the Slack desktop application at [https://slack.com/downloads/](https://slack.com/downloads/) or use it online from your preferred web browser. To sign up for the Slack workspace for this course, visit the invite link [here](https://join.slack.com/t/cs3704-spring2024/shared_invite/zt-2af1mnw9t-5Pxpu_jyMXGUjBRtrmu7GA). If you have problems or are unable to join via the link, contact the instructor.
